# A Java Assignment
A management app for an Assignment for Java module, built with IntelliJ Idea.


This desktop app can:
* Manage CRUD functions for members - add members, and edit their information
* Manage payment - program can calculate a user's fee according to the information in their account record, without needing the staff to input any figures.



This program is *not* intended for commercial use. It is merely a demonstration as a result of the Java module in the Software Engineering diploma programme in APU.
